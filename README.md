# Title - Pacman in Motion

This exercise uses javascript to manipulate DOM. I added some addition buttons to ensure that setTimeOut does get out of control, and that you are able to stop and rest the game.

Another cool idea that I played around with was indtroducing a custom cursor (not implemented) and disappearing img objects on hover.

### Description

This is yet another single page application. Very simple concept introduced and provided by the MIT xPro program. I added addition functionality and s
tyling.
